# technojam-task-DSA

INTRODUCTION-
My name is Lakshay Garg . I am second year student of B.Tech CSE from Galgotias University. Currently started studying DSA in C++ . I want to join the TECHNOJAM club so as to meet new people who have same interests , and to learn from them and gaze experience from seniors . and specially to be in an environment of coding culture.



APPROACHES FOR QUESTIONS-

EASY1- 
In this question we have to just reverse the array . so what I did is , that I started a for loop and initialized it with the last element of array and then decrementing the indices . and simultaneoualy printing the elements , as a result I got them in reverse order.

EASY2-
In this question we have to find the number of pair that the sum of two elements are present which are equal to K . 
in this question I simply used a nested loop to iterate for all cases , and if the condition satisfies I increment the "pair" variable . In the end I got the number of pairs present .

EASY3-
In this question we have to find the missing number from the array of N natural number . In this question firstly I sorted the array with the help of sort() function , then I just started a for loop to check whether the sequence is maintained between the numbers , and applied a condition wherever the sequence will break it will print the next number , thats how we will get out missing number .

MEDIUM2-
In this question we have to make a calculator . In this I just used a naive approach or can say brute force approach and used the switch cases to perform the operations .
But it can be optimised for more cases and operands .

MEDIUM3-
In this question we have to find the factorial of larger numbers . So I used unsigned long long datatype to store the result so that I can store larger values . 
to find the factorial I used a while loop and multiplied the decremented values each time and thats how we get the factorial.

HARD1- 
In this question we have to find the prime numbers present between the range provided .
so in this question we used nested loop to check whether the number is prime or not by the help of bool datatype . and if condition . and if it is prime than print it . the main thing in this code was to initialize the for loop with Range1 and iterating it till R2 . 



CHALLENGES FACED-

I faced a few challenges too , there are some topics which I've not studied completly or even studied . so I was unable to solve those questions . But I'll do them with the coarse of time .
Alse I didn't took care of the time complexity of the codes , I just used Brute force for solving the questions
they can be optimised in future . 
And theres a question in Hard category 3rd question in which I am unable to think of an approach .

In question MEDIUM_3 where we have to find the factorial of large numbers . In this i am facing a problem that my code is not calculating value above "65" .
